# Gesture Zoom Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time hand gesture-based zoom functionality using computer vision. It leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries to detect hand landmarks and control zooming actions based on the gestures recognized by the webcam.

---

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection.
- Zoom in and zoom out using hand gestures.
- Simple and easy-to-run Python script.
- Uses MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection.
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
  - MediaPipe
  - NumPy (if used in your code)
  
You can install these libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
